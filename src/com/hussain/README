The steps of writing an RSA algorithm are:
1. Choose large primes p & q
2. calculate the product n = p * q
3. calculate the Euler's phi function
Φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
4. choose a Public key e that belongs to the set
{1, 2, ....., Φ(n - 1)}
such that gcd(e, Φ(n)) = 1     (relatively primes)
5. compute the Private key d, such that
d * e ≡ 1 (mod Φ(n))

Encryption process:
given public key that consist of n, e
x belongs to the set {1, 2, ...., n - 1}
y ≡ x^e (mod n)

Decryption process:
given private key d,
y belongs to Integers
x ≡ y^d (mod n)
